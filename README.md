# Image-Desktop-Widget-WPF-v3
The Image Desktop Widget app serves as a desktop customization tool, allowing users to pin images in a manner reminiscent of sticky notes. The concept originated in 2017, at a time when Sticky Notes didn't support embedding images.

The application is developed in C# and utilizes the .NET 6 WPF framework.
